<!--## Hi there 👋

Yes, we are developing GhostBSD on GitHub.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**
🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

### Need help?
The best ways to get help are on:
* [Telegram](https://t.me/ghostbsd)
* [The GhostBSD Forums](https://forums.ghostbsd.org)

**Note:** IRC is bridged with Element which is also bridged with Telegram, so users from any of these platform can chat together.
